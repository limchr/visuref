I want to build a website for visualizing and editing reference images for drawing and painting purposes. The user can 1. upload an image or 2. select an image from a reference gallery.

The user can then enable modules in an image processing pipeline. There are modules for changing the contrast, saturation, greyscale, brightness, crop, color palette, grid overlay.

I want to also write a course that has 4 or 5 parts for the user to read about how to draw/paint and that further links to the app for also advertise it.

I thought about a course structure like:

1. Basics

- The importance of observation and “learning to see.”
- Line quality (light, confident, varied strokes).
- Basic shapes (circle, square, triangle) and how everything can be broken down into them. (in reference gallery)
- Exercises: blind contour drawings, gesture lines, filling pages with shapes.

2. Basics 2

- Measuring proportions with your pencil and with help of the grid module of the app
- Symmetry and alignment.
- One-point, two-point, and three-point perspective basics.
- Negative space: drawing what you see, not what you know.
- Exercises: draw simple objects (cups, boxes) in perspective, practice using guidelines.

3. Light, Shadow & Value
- Goal: Add depth and realism through shading.
- Light source and cast shadows.
- Value scale (from light to dark) (greyscale and palette tool)
- Techniques: hatching, cross-hatching, blending, stippling.
- Contrast and composition: how values guide the eye.
- Exercises: draw spheres, cylinders, and cubes with light and shadow (all in reference gallery)

4. Anatomy, Nature & Complex Forms
- Goal: Move from simple objects to complex structures 
- Basic human proportions (head, torso, limbs).
- Simplifying anatomy into cylinders and boxes. (examples in reference gallery)
- Drawing nature: trees, plants, animals with underlying structure.
- Gesture drawing for flow and movement.
- Exercises: quick figure sketches, breaking down animals into basic forms.

5. Style, Creativity & Practice Habits
Goal: Develop your personal style and sustain long-term growth.
Topics to cover:
Studying from references and masters (change parameters of the reference image to explore the 'real' values)
Experimenting with abstraction, exaggeration, and stylization (change number of colors in palette module to see how the complexity of the image changes when adding more distinct colors).
Building a sketchbook habit.
How to critique your own work.
Exercises: daily sketch challenges, copying artists, inventing from imagination.


Please revise and polish the structure.
